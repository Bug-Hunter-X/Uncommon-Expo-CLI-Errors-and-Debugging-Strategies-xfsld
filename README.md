# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors and Debugging Strategies

This repository demonstrates a common yet cryptic error encountered when using Expo's managed workflow and strategies to debug such issues.  The problem stems from incompatibility between Expo's managed workflow and a particular library or feature that requires specific native module configurations.

## Problem Description

The error is often unspecific, making it challenging to pinpoint the root cause using standard debugging techniques.  The error log may be insufficient, and standard troubleshooting steps might not resolve it.  This is exemplified through the use of a third-party library (in the example code, a hypothetical library).

## Solution

The solution generally involves carefully examining dependencies, checking compatibility with the managed workflow, and ensuring proper native module integration.  This might include investigating package documentation, using more verbose logging, testing on a physical device, and potentially switching to a bare workflow if necessary.

The provided solution focuses on enhancing error handling and providing more context for debugging by incorporating more verbose logging throughout the problematic code sections.
