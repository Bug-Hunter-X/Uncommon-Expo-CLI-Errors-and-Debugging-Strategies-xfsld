This error typically occurs when you're using a feature or library in Expo that's not fully compatible with the managed workflow or requires specific configurations. It might manifest as a cryptic error message during build or runtime, indicating problems with native modules, dependencies, or asynchronous operations.  Sometimes the error log is insufficient, making debugging challenging. For example, you might encounter unexpected behavior when using third-party libraries that interact with native device features or have complex setups.
